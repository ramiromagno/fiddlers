Description: A fictional data set about fiddler crabs in the Algarve, Portugal.
    This R data package provides simple demographics and a few morphometric
    variables about three fictitious species of fiddler crabs. It can be useful
    to teach marine biologists the fundamental principles of data science,
    such as tidying and visualisation.
