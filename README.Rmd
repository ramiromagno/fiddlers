`{fiddlers}` is an R data package providing a fictional data set about fiddler
crabs in the Algarve, Portugal.

This R data package provides simple demographics and a few morphometric
variables about three fictitious species of fiddler crabs.

It can be useful to teach marine biologists the fundamental principles of data
science, such as tidying and visualisation.

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")

```

```{r}
library(fiddlers)

```

```{r}
